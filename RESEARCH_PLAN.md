# TIDE-resonance Research Plan

## Phase 1: Theoretical Framework Development (Current)
- [x] Establish resonance hypothesis
- [x] Create pattern-stimulus mapping framework
- [x] Build exploration tools
- [ ] Generate specific testable predictions

## Hypotheses to Test

### H1: Music-Pattern Resonance
Different TIDE patterns will show predictable preferences for musical features:
- ASD-TIDE: Structure, repetition, predictability
- ADHD-TIDE: Energy, novelty, immediacy
- NT-TIDE: Context-dependent flexibility
