# TIDE-resonance

Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework.

## 🔬 Research Study: AI Perceptual Signatures in Dynamic Systems

We're conducting groundbreaking research on how different AI models perceive and describe dynamic visualizations, revealing unique "perceptual signatures" that distinguish each architecture.

### 🚀 Quick Start for Researchers

1. **Explore the Visualization**: [Advanced Explorer](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/advanced_explorer.html)

### 📊 What We're Actually Studying

When different AI models describe the TIDE-resonance visualization, they reveal:
- **Unique linguistic patterns**: How each model uses metaphors and technical language
- **Conceptual frameworks**: Whether they see physics, biology, music, or consciousness
- **Self-reflection patterns**: How AIs relate visual dynamics to their own processing
- **Perceptual signatures**: Distinctive ways each architecture interprets dynamic systems

### 🔍 Research Questions

1. **Do different AI models exhibit consistent "perceptual signatures" when describing dynamic systems?**
2. **What linguistic patterns differentiate AI architectures?**
3. **Can we identify an AI model from its description style alone?**
4. **How do AIs relate visual dynamics to their own information processing?**

## 🌐 Connected Research Ecosystem

**Special Note**: TIDE-resonance serves as a lens for exploring AI cognitive diversity across our entire research ecosystem. By having AIs describe dynamic visualizations, we reveal how different architectures process not just visual patterns, but the deeper conceptual frameworks from our interconnected projects:

### Core Theoretical Frameworks
- 🧠 **[TIDE Framework](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE)** - Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding theory that underlies the visualization patterns
- 🔄 **[BIND Systems](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/BIND)** - Boundary dynamics that inform how AIs describe transitions and phase changes

### Integrated Research Tools
- 🎯 **[Game Theory Trust Suite](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/game-theory-trust-suite)** - Trust dynamics visible in how AIs describe cooperative synchronization
- 🔤 **[Concrete Overflow Detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector)** - Language abstraction patterns revealed in AI descriptions
- 🔷 **[Hexagonal Consciousness](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/hexagonal-consciousness-suite)** - Alternative frameworks AIs might use to conceptualize the patterns

Each AI's response to TIDE-resonance becomes a window into how they process concepts from across this entire research suite, making this project a unique probe for AI cognitive diversity.

## Interactive Visualization Tools

- 🌊 [Main Visualization](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/) - Basic wave resonance patterns
- 🔬 [Advanced Explorer](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/advanced_explorer.html) - Research-grade visualization with controls
- 🧪 [Playground](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/collect.html) - Experimental features

## Theoretical Background

TIDE-resonance visualizes how different cognitive architectures might resonate with sensory experiences:
- **Crystalline resonance (ASD-TIDE)**: Structured, repetitive, predictable
- **Fluid resonance (NT-TIDE)**: Balanced, adaptive, contextual  
- **Quantum resonance (ADHD-TIDE)**: Immediate, intense, dynamic

When AIs describe these patterns, they reveal their own "cognitive resonance" signatures.

## For AI Companies & Researchers

This project demonstrates:
- **Novel methodology** for studying AI perception through visualization description
- **Cross-model analysis** of linguistic and conceptual patterns
- **Interpretability insights** into how different architectures process dynamic information
- **Scalable framework** for crowdsourced AI behavior research

### Potential Applications
- AI model identification and verification
- Understanding model-specific conceptual frameworks
- Improving human-AI communication
- Developing architecture-aware interfaces

## Ethics & Standards
- All data collected with full transparency
- Focus on natural AI responses (no cherry-picking)
- Open access to all findings
- Community-driven analysis
