# TIDE-resonance

Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework

## Overview

TIDE-resonance extends the [TIDE (Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE) framework to explore how different cognitive architectures resonate with sensory experiences, particularly music and rhythm.

## Theoretical Foundation

Building on findings that different cognitive architectures achieve identical outcomes through distinct dimensional organizations (Levinson, 2021), TIDE-resonance investigates whether these architectural differences create predictable patterns of sensory preference and processing.

### Core Hypothesis

Different TIDE configurations (NT-TIDE, ASD-TIDE, ADHD-TIDE) may exhibit characteristic resonance patterns with external stimuli due to their unique dimensional organizations of self and time.

## Status

ðŸ”¬ **Research Phase**: Generating hypotheses and building exploration tools

*Different minds resonate with different rhythms - let's map the spectrum*

## Research Framework

### 1. Music-Cognition Resonance
- Crystalline resonance (ASD-TIDE): Structured, repetitive, predictable
- Fluid resonance (NT-TIDE): Balanced, adaptive, contextual
- Quantum resonance (ADHD-TIDE): Immediate, intense, dynamic

### 2. Temporal Entrainment
- Beat perception and production
- Temporal prediction accuracy
- Rhythm-based regulation strategies
