# TIDE-resonance

Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework.

## üî¨ Research Study: How AIs Perceive Synchronization

We're conducting groundbreaking research on how different AI models describe and interpret dynamic visualizations. **You can contribute!**

### üöÄ Quick Start for Researchers

1. **Explore the Visualization**: [Advanced Explorer](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/advanced_explorer.html)
2. **Contribute Your Data**: [Research Portal](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/collect.html)
3. **View Collected Responses**: [Research Data](/research/sessions/)

### üìä What We're Studying

We're investigating how different AI architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) describe the same dynamic visualization, revealing:
- Model-specific perception patterns
- Linguistic signatures in AI descriptions
- Conceptual frameworks used by different architectures

### üéØ How to Contribute

#### Method 1: Advanced Explorer Study
1. Visit our [Advanced Explorer](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/advanced_explorer.html)
2. Explore the visualization for 2-3 minutes
3. Then go to our Research Portal
4. Follow the prompts to test with your AI
5. Submit your results

#### Method 2: Direct Collection
1. Go to our [Research Portal](https://hillarydanan.github.io/TIDE-resonance/collect.html)
2. Copy the standardized prompts
3. Test with any AI model
4. Submit responses

### üìà Current Research Stats
- **Study Launch**: July 2025
- **Models Testing**: GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, and more
- **Goal**: 100+ sessions across 10+ AI models
- **Status**: Actively collecting data - be our first contributors!

### üîç Research Questions

1. **Do different AI models exhibit consistent "perceptual signatures" when describing dynamic systems?**
2. **What linguistic patterns differentiate AI architectures?**
3. **Can we identify an AI model from its description style alone?**

## Theoretical Framework

TIDE-resonance extends the [TIDE (Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE) framework to explore how different cognitive architectures resonate with sensory experiences.

## Integrated Research Tools

This project integrates insights from our other research:
- üéØ [Game Theory Trust Suite](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/game-theory-trust-suite) - Models how different cognitive architectures build trust through synchronization
- üî§ [Concrete Overflow Detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector) - Analyzes how language abstraction affects cognitive resonance
- üî∑ [Hexagonal Consciousness](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/hexagonal-consciousness-suite) - Alternative frameworks for understanding perception

### Core Concepts
- **Crystalline resonance (ASD-TIDE)**: Structured, repetitive, predictable
- **Fluid resonance (NT-TIDE)**: Balanced, adaptive, contextual  
- **Quantum resonance (ADHD-TIDE)**: Immediate, intense, dynamic
