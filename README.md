# TIDE-resonance
Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework

## Overview
TIDE-resonance extends the [TIDE (Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE) framework to explore how different cognitive architectures resonate with sensory experiences, particularly music and rhythm.

**Important**: We use labels like "NT", "ASD", and "ADHD" as communication tools, not rigid categories. [Read our full perspective on labels and cognitive diversity](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).

**NEW**: Now integrating [game-theoretic trust dynamics](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/game-theory-trust-suite) to model how different cognitive architectures build trust and cooperation through shared sensory experiences.

## Theoretical Foundation
Building on findings that different cognitive architectures achieve identical outcomes through distinct dimensional organizations (Levinson, 2021), TIDE-resonance investigates whether these architectural differences create predictable patterns of sensory preference and processing.

### Core Hypothesis
Different TIDE configurations (NT-TIDE, ASD-TIDE, ADHD-TIDE) may exhibit characteristic resonance patterns with external stimuli due to their unique dimensional organizations of self and time.

*Note: These labels represent cognitive patterns, not fixed categories. [Learn more about our approach to cognitive diversity](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).*

### Trust Dynamics Integration
Drawing from game theory and cooperation research, we explore how trust evolves differently between cognitive architecture pairings, affecting the depth and sustainability of resonance achieved.

### Language Abstraction Effects (Toy Example)
Inspired by [concrete-overflow-detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector), we've added a toy demonstration of how language abstraction levels might affect trust and resonance:
- **NT architectures**: Balanced preference (peak at 0.5 abstractness)
- **ASD architectures**: Higher resonance with concrete language
- **ADHD architectures**: Higher resonance with abstract language

*Note: This is a simplified demonstration to explore how language processing differences could influence trust formation.*

## Status
üî¨ **Research Phase**: Generating hypotheses and building exploration tools

## On Labels and Cognitive Diversity
Please read our [perspective on labels and cognitive diversity](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md). We use terms like "NT," "ASD," and "ADHD" as communication tools to describe patterns, not as rigid diagnostic categories. Human cognition is beautifully diverse and exists on continuous spectrums.
