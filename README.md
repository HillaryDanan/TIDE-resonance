# TIDE-resonance

Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework

## Overview

TIDE-resonance extends the [TIDE (Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE) framework to explore how different cognitive architectures resonate with sensory experiences, particularly music and rhythm.

## Theoretical Foundation

Building on findings that different cognitive architectures achieve identical outcomes through distinct dimensional organizations (Levinson, 2021), TIDE-resonance investigates whether these architectural differences create predictable patterns of sensory preference and processing.

### Core Hypothesis

Different TIDE configurations (NT-TIDE, ASD-TIDE, ADHD-TIDE) may exhibit characteristic resonance patterns with external stimuli due to their unique dimensional organizations of self and time.

## Status

ðŸ”¬ **Research Phase**: Generating hypotheses and building exploration tools
