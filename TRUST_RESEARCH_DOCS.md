## Trust Dynamics in Cognitive Architecture Interactions

### Theoretical Framework
This implementation explores how different cognitive architectures might develop trust through repeated interactions. Based on iterative game theory models (Axelrod, 1984) adapted for cognitive diversity.

### Key Research Questions
1. Do different cognitive architectures develop trust at different rates?
2. How does trust modulate resonance between agents?
3. Can diverse architecture pairings achieve stable cooperation?

### Simulation Parameters
All parameters are theoretical values for research exploration:
- Initial trust: Starting trust level (0-1 normalized)
- Learning rate: How quickly trust updates based on interactions
- Decay rate: How quickly trust returns to baseline without interaction
- Resonance threshold: Minimum compatibility for positive interaction

### Important Limitations
- This is a simplified model for research purposes
- Parameters are theoretical, not based on empirical data
- Not intended for diagnostic or prescriptive use
- Results should be interpreted within research context only
