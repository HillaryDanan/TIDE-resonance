# TIDE-resonance
Empirical explorations of cognitive-sensory resonance patterns within the TIDE framework

## Overview
TIDE-resonance extends the [TIDE (Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE) framework to explore how different cognitive architectures resonate with sensory experiences, particularly music and rhythm.

**Important**: We use labels like "NT", "ASD", and "ADHD" as communication tools, not rigid categories. [Read our full perspective on labels and cognitive diversity](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).

**NEW**: Now integrating [game-theoretic trust dynamics](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/game-theory-trust-suite) to model how different cognitive architectures build trust and cooperation through shared sensory experiences.

## Theoretical Foundation
Building on findings that different cognitive architectures achieve identical outcomes through distinct dimensional organizations (Levinson, 2021), TIDE-resonance investigates whether these architectural differences create predictable patterns of sensory preference and processing.

### Core Hypothesis
Different TIDE configurations (NT-TIDE, ASD-TIDE, ADHD-TIDE) may exhibit characteristic resonance patterns with external stimuli due to their unique dimensional organizations of self and time.

*Note: These labels represent cognitive patterns, not fixed categories. [Learn more about our approach to cognitive diversity](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).*
