# Ethical Considerations

## Core Principles

### 1. Respect for Neurodiversity
- All cognitive patterns are viewed as different, not deficient
- Language emphasizes diversity and avoids pathologizing
- Research aims to understand and support, not fix

### 2. Scientific Integrity
- All theoretical components clearly labeled
- No claims beyond what data supports
- Hypotheses presented as testable, not facts

### 3. Participant Protection
- No diagnostic tools or claims
- Clear informed consent protocols
- Data privacy and security prioritized

### 4. Accessibility
- Tools designed for diverse users
- Multiple modalities for interaction
- Open source for community benefit

### 5. Responsible Application
- Research purposes only
- Not for commercial exploitation
- Community input valued
