# Research Standards for TIDE-Resonance AI Pattern Study

## Objective
Document observable patterns in AI system outputs when presented with synchronization visualization concepts.

## What This Research IS:
- A systematic collection of AI outputs
- An analysis of response patterns across different architectures
- A reproducible methodology for studying AI outputs
- An open dataset for further research

## What This Research IS NOT:
- A claim about AI consciousness or sentience
- An assertion about AI internal states
- A comparison of AI "intelligence" or capabilities
- An anthropomorphization of computational systems

## Methodological Standards
1. Use exact same prompts for all systems
2. Document model versions and parameters
3. Preserve original outputs without editing
4. Use objective language in analysis
5. Note limitations and potential biases

## Language Guidelines
- Use "the system outputs" not "the AI thinks"
- Use "response patterns" not "AI experiences"  
- Use "processing characteristics" not "AI feelings"
- Use "computational behavior" not "AI preferences"

## Data Integrity
- No cherry-picking of responses
- Include all sessions, even unclear ones
- Document any technical issues
- Note when responses cannot be reproduced
