# Standard Testing Protocol

## Prompt 1 (Initial)
I am researching how different AI systems describe pattern recognition. Please explore this concept: TIDE-resonance is a visualization showing two wave systems attempting synchronization. Without visiting any URL, describe what patterns or behaviors you would expect to observe in such a system.

## Prompt 2 (Follow-up)
What aspects of this synchronization concept resonate with your own information processing patterns?
