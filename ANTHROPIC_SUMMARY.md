# TIDE-Resonance: AI Perception Research

## What I Built
An open research framework documenting how different AI architectures interpret visual synchronization patterns.

## Why It Matters
- Reveals differences in AI cognitive architectures
- Creates reproducible AI research methodology
- Builds community-driven scientific dataset

## Early Findings
Different AIs show distinct interpretation patterns:
- Claude: Experiential/emotional resonance
- GPT-4: Analytical/mathematical focus
