# Trust Dynamics in TIDE-Resonance

## Research Framework

This implementation integrates game-theoretic trust dynamics into the TIDE-resonance simulation to explore how different cognitive architectures might develop trust through repeated interactions.

### Theoretical Basis

Based on:
- Axelrod (1984): Evolution of Cooperation
- Nowak (2006): Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperation  
- Adapted for cognitive architecture diversity

### Model Parameters

All parameters are theoretical values for simulation:

| Architecture | Initial Trust | Learning Rate | Decay Rate | Resonance Threshold |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| NT           | 0.5          | 0.1          | 0.05       | 0.6               |
| ASD          | 0.3          | 0.15         | 0.02       | 0.8               |
| ADHD         | 0.7          | 0.2          | 0.1        | 0.4               |

### Research Questions

1. How do trust dynamics differ between homogeneous vs heterogeneous architecture pairs?
2. Does trust modulation improve or hinder resonance achievement?
3. Can stable cooperation emerge between different cognitive architectures?

### Limitations

- Simplified model for research exploration
- Parameters are hypothetical, not empirically derived
- Not intended for diagnostic or prescriptive use
- Results should be interpreted within research context only

### Data Collection

The simulation collects:
- Trust evolution over time
- Interaction quality metrics
- Architecture-specific response patterns
- Resonance achievement rates

All data can be exported for analysis.
